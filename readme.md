# Spanlib

This project aims to create a pedagogical web application that allows students of Spanish and other foreign languages to create Mad Libs and learn about grammar at the same time.

## Initializing the database and adding sample entries

To get started, first fork and clone this repository. `cd` into the repository and run the following commands in the terminal:
```
python3 database_setup.py
python3 add_samples.py
```
The first command will run a python that script that sets up the database and the second command will add some sample entries to the database.

## Adding your Google API credentials. 
You will need to add your Google API credentials as a file named client_secrets.json to the working directory. As of now, the only way to login to this app (which is needed to create a Mad Lib is through the Google OAuth API)


## Assessing the API
In order to access the API end points `stories/JSON` and `words/JSON` which will respectively provide all of the words and stories in the database, you must create an account. To do this, you will need to send a POST request to the `/api/users` route.

For example, use curl on the command line as so: 
`curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"Max","password":"testpassword","name":"max","email":"max@max.com"}' http://localhost:8000/api/users`

Now, when sending GET requets to the API endpoints: `stories/JSON` and `words/JSON` make sure to provide your username and password.

For example, use using curl as so:
```curl -u Max:testpassword -i -X GET http://localhost:8000/words/JSON``` will return all of the words in the database

And using,
```curl -u Max:testpassword -i -X GET http://localhost:8000/stories/JSON``` will return all of the words.
